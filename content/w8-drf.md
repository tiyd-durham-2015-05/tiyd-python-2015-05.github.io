Django REST Framework (DRF) is big, as is the concept of building APIs. Some resources
you may want to check out:

* The chapter on DRF in [Two Scoops of Django](http://twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8) is great
and worth reading if you have a copy.
* [Classy Django REST Framework](http://www.cdrf.co/) gives you all the sources
you need to see how these views and viewsets work.
* GoDjango has a set of DRF screencasts ([part 1](https://godjango.com/41-start-your-api-django-rest-framework-part-1/), [part 2](https://godjango.com/43-permissions-authentication-django-rest-framework-part-2/),
[part 3](https://godjango.com/45-viewsets-and-routers-django-rest-framework-part-3/))
* [How Django REST Framework Changed My Life](http://ngenworks.com/technology/how-django-rest-framework-changed-my-life/) is a good read if you're getting demoralized. :)
