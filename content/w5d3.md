Clinton was on a sick day today, so we changed plans. We watched the following videos:

* [Machine Learning 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-1XJBHot58)
* [Hands On Data Analysis (starting at 1:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4Hbv4ugUWk&feature=youtu.be&t=1h42m22s)

This video is recommended watching for those who want to go above and beyond:

* [Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn I](http://pyvideo.org/video/3429/machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-i)

We started the weekend homework early:

* [Programming Language Classifier](https://github.com/tiyd-python-2015-05/programming-language-classifier)
